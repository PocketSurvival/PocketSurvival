**Problem**:

   Statistics have shown that the growing reliance on technology has caused a decrease in knowledge about general tasks that can easily
  decidelife or death. The problem at hand is that younger generations are learning less due to the fact that everything they need to know
  can be easily searched on the Internet. These things include how to change a tire, how to perform CPR, and much more. These tasks are not
  often categorized as a necessity for survival, but can easily save you money by doing the task yourself instead of hiring outside.
  According to Daily Mail, three-quarters of adults surveyed between twenty and thirty-five believe that more practical knowledge about
  accomplishing everyday tasks would help them save money.  More often than not, people are deciding to spend money on replacements rather
  than fixing it themselves. 
    The abilities stated above are not committed to memory and are very important to function in the case of an
  emergency. An example of this can be seen in the shocking statistics provided by NBC News stating that 60% of drivers surveyed are unable
  to change their tire, and an even more shocking fact is that 85% of drivers are not confident in their ability to change their carâ€™s oil.
  These tasks are not limited to simply car maintenance, but also involve tasks about survival in the wilderness. When stranded, it is
  important to know or at least have access to the information on how to start a fire, find shelter, and gather food. The knowledge of
  these are often overlooked and deemed unnecessary to remember. In order to combat this, our solution is an app with relevant information
  described below.

**Solution**:

   Our solution to this problem is a simple survival application called Pocket Survival. This app compiles relevant information that is
  otherwise disregarded. The information includes things like simple tips on how to survive if stranded and other tasks such as how to
  unclog a pipe will be provided in the app. Pocket Survival aims to provide its users with the information to carry out tasks that are
  not commonly known how to do. In addition, Pocket Survival will support the functionality of saving documents on the app offline in the
  case that you need access to them without having proper service. This added functionality further supports the premise of the
  app: provide users with the necessary information in order to survive in not only daily tasks, but also those that involve life and
  death.

**Process**:
  When implementing the agile method to our project, we will mainly focus on incremental delivery. We have broken up the stages we will
  focus on the GUI, getting relevant documents on a server that is then accessed by the app, and adding the ability to save documents
  offline. Given the time available before our mid October deadline, we will have 4 sprints of a week each where the first three are as
  described above and the fourth being working out kinks and adding more relevant documents to the application. Additionally, throughout
  the process, we hope to get customer involvement at the end of every sprint cycle. We will not move on to the next increment until we
  have properly implemented the part before. 
	 In addition, we plan on implementing user stories to better test our final product to ensure it meets the needs expected. However, our
  group has decided to stray away from pair programming and instead code together as a team. We believe our team is small enough where we
  can all gain something from coding together. Additionally, we all hope to gain much knowledge and experience from building an app from
  the bottom up instead of each of us working on different parts.
