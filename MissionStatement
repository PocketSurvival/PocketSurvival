Our team has decided that in the age of technology people have become far too dependent on constantly having an internet connection
that will allow them access to solutions to any problems at anytime. However, we have all experienced a moment when we are without
a connection and a problem we do not know how to solve has arisen. That is the reason for the creation of Pocket Survival. It will
be an offline app that has detailed explanations on a number of problems that people may need answers to quickly. Heimlich 101,
how to change a flat tire, how to jump start a vehicle, how to make a fire with only twigs and leaves... there are a number of
scenarios that can arise without a connection. Our team is trying to bring survival books into the twenty first century and help
those who do not know when they may need it.
